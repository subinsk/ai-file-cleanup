This document contains important information about the AI File Cleanup project.
It demonstrates the system's ability to detect exact duplicate files using SHA-256 hashing.

This is particularly useful for finding backup copies and accidentally duplicated files.

Features:
- Fast hash-based matching
- 100% accuracy for exact duplicates
- No false positives
- Efficient storage savings

Use cases:
- Finding backup copies
- Identifying accidentally copied files
- Cleaning up downloads folders
- Managing large file collections
