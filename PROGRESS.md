## 📝 Notes

### Achievements So Far
- ✅ Established robust monorepo structure with TurboRepo
- ✅ Complete type system with runtime validation (Zod)
- ✅ Production-ready deduplication algorithms
- ✅ Comprehensive hashing and similarity utilities
- ✅ Complete database layer with Prisma + pgvector
- ✅ Full REST API with authentication & licenses
- ✅ AI embeddings service with transformers.js
- ✅ Well-documented codebase with JSDoc comments
- ✅ All packages building successfully

### Key Technical Decisions
- ✅ TurboRepo for monorepo (fast, incremental builds)
- ✅ Zod for runtime validation (type safety)
- ✅ Prisma for database (great DX, migrations)
- ✅ transformers.js for AI (single runtime, easier deployment)
- ✅ all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for text (smaller, faster than DistilBERT)
- ✅ CLIP for images (industry standard)
- ✅ Fastify for API (fast, modern)
- ✅ Cookie-based sessions (simpler for MVP)

### Current Session Goals
1. ✅ Complete model worker service
2. ✅ Update all documentation
3. ✅ Complete UI package
4. ✅ Build all core React components (8 components + 2 hooks)
