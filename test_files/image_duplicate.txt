This is a placeholder for an image file. In a real test scenario, you would have actual image files here.

For testing image deduplication, you would typically include:
- Same image in different formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- Same image with different compression levels
- Same image with different sizes/resolutions
- Similar images with slight modifications

Since we can't create actual binary image files in this text-based environment, 
this serves as a placeholder to indicate where image test files would go.
